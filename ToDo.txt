Fixed sons of nature not gathering lumber if gathering rate is less than 1 lumber per second.
Fixed "Give All" resources button not working.
Fixed troll losing resources when buying items with full inventory.
Fixed troll items giving 10 times more hp regen than it actually should.
Might have fixed showing food as "undefined" after reconnecting (Not sure as I can't really test it easily).
Removed 2 spots on winter map where elves could blink-in and troll couldn't reach.


#2
Reworked logic when units die, the change might have fixed elf's buildings not getting destroyed and not giving a choice for angel/wolf when elf dies.
Reworked troll invis.
Fixed allowing elves to blink outside the map.
Fixed troll swallowing items when he had full inventory and wolves tried to give him items.

#3
Added ability placeholders for max level troll hut and trader, so their abilities get the same hotkeys no matter what level the buildings are. (Should upgrade building ability be moved to an item instead?)
Abilities that don't have hotkeys will be given unused item hotkeys (Don't change your hotkeys after starting the game (you can shuffle items in your inventory)).
When gold wisps start building the gold mine they get deselected.


#4
Reworked building building/upgrading logic, should be way more efficient.
Modified entity dying logic (Please report if wall glitches or troll respawning glitches still happen).


TODO:
Fix poison tower stuff.
Fix setup.js events wasting resources.
Fix 2 trolls (game stages).
Fix building upgrading ancestor logic.
Fix "Dead" notification when upgrading multiple units at once.
